- This is the Group effort from the group: Springers

However as we talked with Prof. Sven Jörges on the lab session on 09/01/2025 the remained members are going to be only "Faraz Chahybakhsh 7219098"
 since "Adam Kwoska" and I was the only members; however he decided to drop this module and we talked with Prof. Jörges and he said as long as project's
front-end works and backend is also working, and the prototype is presentable, it is fine. 

Thank you for your Attention!
